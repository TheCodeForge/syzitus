Additionally, you grant {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} a permanent, worldwide, and irrevocable license to sublicense these same rights to {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }}'s service providers. Additionally, you warrant that you are authorized to grant {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} these rights.

You retain all other intellectual property rights, including ownership.

## Guildmaster Terms

{{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} provides you with the ability to create, manage, and moderate communities ("Guilds") within {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }}. As a moderator ("Guildmaster") of a Guild, you will not:

* Accept payment, gifts, or other compensation in exchange for performing Guildmaster actions.

* Penalize users for content or conduct outside of your Guild
* Require integration with any third-party platform or service as a prerequisite for user participation in the Guild.
* Deliberately miscategorize your Guild.

## Multiple Accounts

You will not use multiple accounts to circumvent per-user limits. Examples of such limits include, but are not limited to:

* Maximum one upvote or downvote per post or comment
* Maximum ten Guilds moderated at one time
* Maximum two Guilds created per day
* Maximum one Guild siege attempt per rolling week

## Your Privacy

{{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} will never intentionally share your personal information with third parties, except:

* As required by United States law.
* We will share your data with our own service providers which are necessary for {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }} operations. The exact service providers are subject to change without notice.

* DMCA takedown request
* DMCA takedown counter-request

You agree to refrain from making abusive or frivolous submissions to these forms. Additionally, you acknowledge that these forms are provided for the sake of convenience and speed, and that {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} does not waive any of its rights regarding legal process, including the right to object for lack of proper service.

> {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} considers abusive and frivolous submissions to be submissions with a clear lack of legal justification.

You are responsible for all fees, penalties, or other expenses due to chargebacks, reversed transactions, or refunds associated with your account.

{{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} reserves the right to remove content that we deem to violate content policy or the terms of service, and to deactivate accounts responsible for such violations.

## Severability

If one clause of these Terms or the Content Policy is determined by a court to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms and Content Policy shall remain in force.

## No Implied Waiver

A failure by {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} in one or more instances to insist upon your strict adherence to these terms or the Content Policy, shall not be construed as a waiver of any continuing or subsequent violations of these terms or the Content Policy.

## Completeness

These Terms contain all the terms and conditions agreed upon by You and {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} regarding your use of the {{ "SERVER_NAME" | app_config }} service. No other agreement, oral or otherwise, will be deemed to exist or to bind either of the parties to this Agreement.

## Governing Law

These terms of service are governed by, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the state of New Hampshire. You consent to the sole jurisdiction of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire for all disputes between you and {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} LLC, and you consent to the sole application of New Hampshire state law and United States federal law for all such disputes.

## Updates

{{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} may periodically update these terms of service and/or the Content Policy. When this happens, {{ "SITE_NAME" | app_config }} will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such changes.
